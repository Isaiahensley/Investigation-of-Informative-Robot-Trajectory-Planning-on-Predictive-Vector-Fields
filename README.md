# Investigation-of-Informative-Robot-Trajectory-Planning-on-Predictive-Vector-Fields
The goal of this research is to study aquatic environments such as lakes, rivers, and bayous by gathering information on spatiotemporal variability. Traditionally, we rely on manual sampling by humans from such environments or sparse measurements from static sensors. In such scenarios, we envision to utilize an underwater robot
with multi-modal sensors to gather in-situ measurements. However, it is also crucial to reason about both spatial and temporal variations of water currents for efficient robotic information gathering. Therefore, a team of students in their capstone project will compute informative robot trajectories under predicted water flow dynamics that will drive the robot with motion constraints to several locations for gathering the maximum information from an aquatic environment. In this project,
students will train a deep transformer neural network for learning water flow dynamics in continuous domains from a large real water current dataset. They will then develop a prototype software tool for implementing the proposed sampling-based information gathering algorithm that will generate robot trajectories for random samples on predicted water flow dynamics. Finally, students will validate the overall approach with extensive simulation runs and multiple physical experiments with a real robot. Through this project, students will gain experience in applying deep learning models, robot motion planning algorithms, experimental validation, and performance analysis along with handling the hardware and software of a physical underwater robot.
